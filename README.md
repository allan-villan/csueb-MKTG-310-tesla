This GitHub repository houses a Marketing Research project a group and I completed at Cal State East Bay. This project involved deriving insights from surveys, that we created and administered, to get a deeper look at the survey pool's general demographics, their current financial status, as well as insights pertaining to any current / future vehicles. A variety of brands were included to isolate independant variables for more detailed analysis of the survey results.

## Technologies Used:
1) Google Sheets
2) Microsoft Excel 
3) IBM SPSS Statistics
4) Microsoft Word

## Contents:
- Final Report Tesla.docx
- Tesla Converted Data.xlsx

### Student Learning Outcomes for the course:
- Demonstrate an understanding of the role and process of research in making marketing decisions.
- Apply skills and techniques in designing data collection instruments including surveys.
- Apply skills in collecting and coding primary data.
- Analyze marketing research information to guide managerial decisions.
- Utilize the appropriate statistical software for data analysis.
- Communicate marketing research results in both oral and written form.
- Integrate knowledge, skills, and techniques of marketing research in a marketing research project.

## Recommendations (Analysis done in 2019)
Based on survey results, we found that:
- The younger generation was more willing to buy electric powered vehicles
- It's difficult to identify who's willing and able to purchase a Tesla because most of those interviewed were college students
- By focusing on performance, price, then looks for future models, Tesla can distinguish themselves from the companies included in the survey
- With North America reaching its saturation point for Model 3's, Tesla should focus on other developed markets that are beginning to enforce more strict environmental laws, China and Europe being prime candidates
- Because 55.56% of the people that were interviewed were between the ages of 19-23, our recommendations were skewed to releasing a cheaper alternative to the Model 3

## Conclusion:
The project received an **A** due to meeting all requirements. A key focus of this project was to make *data-driven decisions*, only using *personal bias* and *intuition* to find correlations in the data that is significant enough to act upon.

### It was *difficult* but ***rewarding***.

When discussing the direction of the project with my groupmates, I was a large influence in making *data-driven suggestions*. Because the use of statistics and working with data was new to a majority of my group, I took hold of the helm and guided us to the finish line. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I'm grateful to have taken this course as it marks the date for my interest in working with data full-time.
